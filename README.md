<h1 align="center">🌟 Color Picker IOS 🌟</h1>

<!-- Description -->
<p align="center">This project is pretty simple. You have your slider and button to make a color within the Color Picker app. 
I find this useful and have used it in many occactions for picking colors in for a object in a game and finding the right paint for the wall of the house.
You are free to use it as you wish without my permission. </p>
